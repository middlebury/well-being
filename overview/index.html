How do you make decisions about substance use that align with your goals and values? Middlebury provides plenty of options for getting the foods we need—and like—every day. Thirty percent of the food in our dining halls is locally sourced, and our own Organic Farm contributes seasonal produce. Plus you can meet one-on-one with a nutritionist for guidance—or work with a counselor or health educator to explore your substance use, judgment free.</p>

Is it second nature for you to recycle those papers? Is the chair you're sitting in designed for the hours of work you have ahead? Have you ever tried to climb that mountain you can see out the Davis Family Library window?</p>

A 2010 Harvard study determined that the average person is distracted from what they're doing for 47 percent of their day. That's not all that surprising given our digital age and the fast-paced and exhilarating academic environment at Middlebury. Contemplative practices and reflection can help. They are two strategies to help you be fully present in the moment and feel more in touch with how you move through the day.</p>

              <div class="topic-article__content"><p>How do you feel about the community in which you live, learn, and work? Which relationships fuel you? Which drain you? Living and working on a busy college campus can be exciting and overwhelming at the same time. How you spend your time and the relationships you build are essential to your sense of well-being. Do you enjoy volunteering? Do you feel strongly about college policies? What do you look for and value in your friends and colleagues?</p>
