**Movement and Rest**

What helps you feel energized and motivated to face the day? How do you create a life that supports balance and restoration? Where do you find movement that feels best to you? From a short walk around campus to a longer walk or run on the Trail Around Middlebury to classes like yoga and jazzercise or making use of the activities and facilities in the athletic complex, movement during the day can improve your mood, reduce stress, and prepare your body for a good night&#39;s sleep.

**Nutrition**

What does eating well mean to you? How do you choose foods that sustain your health and fit into your lifestyle? How do you make decisions about substance use that align with your goals and values? Middlebury provides plenty of options for getting the foods we need—and like—every day. Thirty percent of the food in our dining halls is locally sourced, and our own Organic Farm contributes seasonal produce. Plus you can meet one-on-one with a nutritionist for guidance—or work with a counselor or health educator to explore your substance use, judgment free.

**Spiritual**

How do your beliefs and values guide your actions and emotions? Spiritual well-being can happen on many levels, and is different for everyone. With that in mind, we help create the spaces and opportunities for you to take time to pause and consider what&#39;s important to you, what gives you a sense of purpose, and what grounds you in this community.

**Physical Environment**

How does your physical space feel? Does it enliven your senses and foster creativity? Your surroundings at home and work can affect your physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being. One of the best things about living and working on a college campus in central Vermont is the incredible access we have to the natural and built environment around us. Is it second nature for you to recycle those papers? Is the chair you&#39;re sitting in designed for the hours of work you have ahead? Have you ever tried to climb that mountain you can see out the Davis Family Library window?

**Mind-Body Connection**

How do your mind and body inform each other in your experiences? A 2010 Harvard study determined that the average person is distracted from what they&#39;re doing for 47 percent of their day. That&#39;s not all that surprising given our digital age and the fast-paced and exhilarating academic environment at Middlebury. Contemplative practices and reflection can help. They are two strategies to help you be fully present in the moment and feel more in touch with how you move through the day.

**Community**

How do you feel about the community in which you live, learn, and work? Which relationships fuel you? Which drain you? Living and working on a busy college campus can be exciting and overwhelming at the same time. How you spend your time and the relationships you build are essential to your sense of well-being. Do you enjoy volunteering? Do you feel strongly about college policies? What do you look for and value in your friends and colleagues?

**Financial**

How do you balance your wants and needs? From your first piggy bank to your current savings account, financial responsibility can be enormously empowering. With help from money-coaching programs like My Secure Advantage and the incredible team in Student Financial Services, you can define and set goals for both the near and long term—and also see and understand how things work best in the world of savings.
