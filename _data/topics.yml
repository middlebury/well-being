- title: Movement and Rest
  summary: How to get the exercise and sleep that feels right for your body.
  content: Getting outside can lighten your mood—even just a short walk around campus. Swing through McCullough and pick up your mail. Take a yoga or jazzercise class, subsidized for faculty and staff by the Wellness Committee. Visit the athletic center where there are plenty of activities to try. Or venture farther for a walk or run on the Trail Around Middlebury. Most importantly, though, get the sleep you need to feel energized for the day.

- title: Nutrition
  summary: Nourish your body, strengthen your mind.
  content: Most of us have been hearing about the importance of eating well since we were kids. Lucky for us, Middlebury provides plenty of options for getting the foods we need—and like—every day. The student-run Juice Bar offers organic choices, including smoothies. XX% of the food in our dining halls is locally sourced, and our own Organic Farm contributes seasonal produce. Plus you can meet one-on-one with a nutritionist for guidance—or share your own nutritional knowledge with others.

- title: Spirituality
  summary: Find what fulfills you in life.
  content: Spiritual well-being can happen on many levels, and is different for everyone. It&#39;s how your beliefs and values guide your actions and emotions—and on a campus as close-knit as ours, it can be hard to hold on to that sense of self. With that in mind, we provide the spaces and opportunities for you to take the time to pause and consider what&#39;s important to you, what gives you a sense of purpose, and what grounds you in this community.

- title: The Environment
  summary: Ways to engage with the space around you.
  content: One of the best things about living and working on a college campus in central Vermont is the incredible access we have to the people in our community and the natural and physical environment around us. Each and every one of us plays a role in the well-being of our fellow beings and the spaces we work and live in. Take time to explore your surroundings and consider what works best for you. Is it second nature for you to recycle those papers? Is the chair you&#39;re sitting in designed for the hours of work you have ahead? Have you ever tried to climb that mountain you can see out the Davis Library window?

- title: Mind-Body Connection
  summary: How to feel fully present in your everyday life.
  content: In a 2010 Harvard study, researchers determined that the average person is distracted from what they&#39;re doing for 47% of their day. That&#39;s not all that surprising given our collective reliance on mobile devices. So what can you do about it? Make time for contemplative practices and reflection in your day. Tune into your daily experiences and make a note to be fully present in the moment. Be more aware of how you move through the day—and make sure you&#39;re getting the nourishment and rest you need.

- title: Community
  summary: Foster your healthy and engaged relationships.
  content: Living and working on a college campus can be exciting and overwhelming all at the same time. There&#39;s a lot going on almost all the time. How you spend your time, and the relationships you develop with those around you, are essential to our daily sense of well-being. Do you enjoy volunteering in town? Do you feel strongly about being part of college policies? What kinds of things do you like to do in your free time? It&#39;s important to understand what fuels you in a positive way, and what you look for and value in your friends and colleagues.
